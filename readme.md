# Payslip Checking Assistance Tool

Aims to minimise time it takes to check your payslip, so you can get back to living your life without NMHS rolling you for your net worth.

## Usage

Required information:
- Your payslip in .pdf format
- Your roster

Launch the program and select your payslip.
You are required to input your roster times into the program manually.

The tool will compare the roster and payslip and list any discrepancies, as well as the **financial delta** of those discrepancies.
